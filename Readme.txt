Script: Adobe Illustrator Shape ClonerGPT
===============================

Thank you for downloading the Illustrator Shape ClonerGPT script! This script allows you to clone a shape at the anchor points of another shape (path, compound shape, or group) in Adobe Illustrator.

Usage:
1. Install the Script:
   - Open Adobe Illustrator.
   - Go to "File" > "Scripts" > "Other Script..."
   - Browse and select the "IllustratorShapeClonerGPT.jsx" file.

2. Select Shapes:
   - Select two objects: one to use as the source shape (circle) and another as the target shape you want to clone.

3. Running the Script:
   - Once the two shapes are selected, run the script by choosing "IllustratorShapeCloner" from "File" > "Scripts" > "IllustratorShapeCloner".

4. Cloning:
   - The script will clone the target shape at each anchor point of the source shape.
   - The center of the cloned shapes will align with the center of the anchor points.

5. Grouping (Optional):
   - The cloned shapes will be grouped together for easy organization.
   - The new group will be selected after the cloning is completed.

Note:
- The script works with paths, compound shapes, and groups as the source object.
- Text converted to outlines (compound paths within groups) is supported as well.
